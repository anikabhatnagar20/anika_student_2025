Purpose of Else Statements: Handles what happens when the if condition is false.
Structure of If-Else:
- If statement with a condition.
- Else statement without a condition.
- Both parts have code blocks surrounded by {}.

1. Based on this code, if you were younger than 16 what would it print out?
2. Write your own if else statement


Else If Statements: Used when you have multiple conditions that need to be checked sequentially.

Flow of Execution: Each condition is evaluated in the order written. The first true condition's code runs, and the rest are skipped.

Structure:

- Start with a single if statement.
- Follow with as many else if statements as needed.
- Optionally end with one else to handle any remaining cases.
Key Concept: The order of conditions matters. More specific conditions should come before broader ones to ensure accurate results.

1. If I was 19 what would it print out? 
2. If I was 14 what would it print out? 
3. Create your if statement with one else if condition.
