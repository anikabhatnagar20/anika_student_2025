## Tools Installation Hack
Shell commands:

ls= lists out all of my directories
cd=this changes my directory.
mkdir= creates a new directory
rm= removes a directory
git clone= clones a repo for me to use
--version= shows the version number of a program
Brew commands:
-brew list= list installed packages
-brew search <package_name>= search for a package
-brew update= update Homebrew
-brew upgrade= upgrade installed packages
-brew uninstall <package_name>= uninstall a package
Version control:
Cloning a repo brings it on to your own local machine, and also allows you to edit it. To update files in the repo you would need to commit changes and pushing the changes.

Localhost vs. Deployed Server:
local host means it can only be viewed on your local laptop. The url typically looks like http://127.0.0.1:4100/student_2025/
When it is deployed that means anyone can see it. The urls for deployed servers can be customized but are usually the github username and repo name.

DNS and GitHub Pages:
https://username.github.io/repository/ is the domain provided by GitHub. Each GitHub Pages site has a unique URL based on the GitHub username and repository name, so it will be different from other sites.


Summary:
In the development process, GitHub and GitHub Pages are key tools for managing versions and deploying websites. Locally, you test and view your project through a localhost URL (e.g., http://localhost:4000), which is only visible to you. This is ideal for development and testing. Once deployed on GitHub Pages, however, your project is available to the public via a URL (e.g., https://username.github.io/repository/), making it accessible to anyone online.
The Domain Name System (DNS) is essential for handling web addresses. GitHub Pages provides a default URL under github.io, but if you configure a custom domain, DNS ensures that traffic directed to your custom domain (e.g., https://www.yourdomain.com) is routed to your GitHub Pages site. This customization provides a more branded and professional web address.
In summary, localhost is used for private, local development; GitHub Pages serves for public deployment; and DNS manages custom domain names for a personalized web presence.
